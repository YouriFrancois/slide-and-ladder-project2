when I was younger i use to play chute and ladder with my little sisters it use to be really fun we use to play for hours
I use to always want to add my own spin into it.

I created a mini board game of chutes and ladders where the user can pick if he wants to move 1 2 or 3 squares and he doesn't know what square will make him go up or down I used the ruby rails api to save the move the user makes and if the user wants to continue a game they can later.
The user can delete any games that they do not want to continue.



====================================

for version 2
I want to add a part where is similar to the normal version where the user will have to get random number of jump
and they will be able to see which go up or down
